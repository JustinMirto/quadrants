# QUADRANTS
Quadrants is a puzzle game created by Eric, Justin, Mohammed and Lawrence - members of Group 2.2F

The objective of the game is to slide or rotate quadrants to retrieve an orb and win the level.

Players can drag and release square quadrants to slide them or click on L shaped quadrants to rotate them.

The player must be careful, as they only have three lifes - if they run out, they lose the level

There are three levels, increasing in difficulty

Level 1 – Mystic Forest
Level 2 – Sandy Dessert
Level 3 – Enchanted Temple
